**Prerequisites**:
- bonsai DAQmx Library
- NI DAQmx driver from the [NI website](https://www.ni.com/en-gb/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daqmx.html#348669)

**Category**: Sink

**Brief**: Writes a sequence of logical values to one or more DAQmx digital output channels

**Input** (*bool*)

**Properties**:
- `Channels` (*System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection&lt;Bonsai.DAQmx.DigitalOutputChannelConfiguration&gt;*) - all analog output channels that the voltage signal will be fed to, specified by adding channels in the `DigitalOutputChannelConfiguration Collection Editor` and setting its parameters as appropriate:
    - `ChannelName` - can be anything
    - `Grouping` - specifies how to group digital output lines into virtual channels; if one or more ports are specified with the `Lines` parameter, this must be `OneChannelForEachLine` (instead of `OneChannelForAllLines`)
    - `Lines` - the physical digital output line on the board, selected from the drop-down list once the device is connected

**Output** (*bool*)

**Tip**: A boolean square pulse can be generated by sampling from `FunctionGenerator` (`BufferLength` = 1) one item at a time and applying a threshold (e.g. using `GreaterThan`) to obtain output of type *bool*. This method seems to work well for `SamplingRate` <= 100 Hz. Note that `Frequency` must be less than half of the `SamplingRate` value in line with the Nyquist Sampling Theorem.

 If higher frequency signals are needed, a combination of `FunctionGenerator` and `AnalogOutput` can  be used instead (where possible).

**Common errors**:

`Runtime Error: Device cannot be accessed`
Most likely happens because the NI-DAQmx device is not connected/powered. Several other possible reasons and remedies are listed in the bonsai error message.
