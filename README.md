# bonsai-rx-docs

**unofficial documentation for bonsai-rx**

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. Check the [documentation tutorial pages](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction) if you are a new developer.

If you'd like to contribute docs but aren't interested in developing the documentation site, just use the **edit** buttons and submit pull requests, or submit an issue to request a new page.

# How to build the site locally

Make sure you have the `yarn` Node package by installing with the package manager of your choice (brew, chocolatey, etc).

## Installation

If it's your first time cloning and developing in the repo, install the requisite Node packages.

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service. Once your changes build, submit a pull request for your changes to be reviewed.

## Deployment

Coming soon!
