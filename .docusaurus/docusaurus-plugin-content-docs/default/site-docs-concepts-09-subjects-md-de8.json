  "description": "Subjects are a special type of operator that allows reusing and sharing of observable sequences. A subject acts as a bridge or proxy; it will subscribe to an observable sequence and reemit all items it receives to downstream operators. Subjects play a role similar to branches by allowing multiple operators to subscribe to a single observable sequence.",
