  "description": "The TakeUntil operator allows you to stop an observable sequence when a notification is emitted from a second observable. TakeUntil starts by forwarding all notifications from the first observable. As soon as a notification is received from the second observable, TakeUntil cancels the subscription to the first observable and terminates successfully.",
